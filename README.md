The repo for the "query resolver" is [here](https://github.com/wrecodde/travelinfo). Deployed [here](https://travelinfo-api-staging.herokuapp.com/resolve). Use [this](https://www.notion.so/wrecodde/API-Documentation-9fd02a5b57344d328265a6380e5437c4) for documentation.

The repo for the chatbot, a type of "data retrieval" is [here](https://github.com/wrecodde/travelinfo-bot). To be deployed.

### General Information
TravelInfo was built to help the traveller know where public transport terminals are in each state. And which destination you can travel to from a terminal.

For example, TravelInfo can tell you that there are X number of interstate terminals in Lagos State, and if you want to get a bus going to Kaduna, you need to go to Terminal XYZ.

That is what TravelInfo does.

You can get this information via the [chatbot](https://travelinfo-staging.herokuapp.com/chatbot).

### App components
There are three parts to this application: data entry, query resolver, data retrieval.

This is the data entry part.

TravelInfo relies on contributors to tell us knowledge of terminals they've visted and states they've travelled to.

So please, go ahead to [add new terminals](https://travelinfo-staging.herokuapp.com/terminals/new), or update information on already added terminals. You can edit the description of how to get to that terminal, or if a connected state/terminal has not been added, you can do that.

### GitHub and contribution
TravelInfo is being built in the open and welcomes your contribution.
